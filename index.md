> Online collections make textile heritage accessible, yet many users struggle to move beyond search-and-retrieve toward **deep understanding**, especially when meanings are culturally situated across countries.

## Interview invitation
<a id="interview-invitation"></a>

I am inviting museum / heritage / HCI / digital heritage researchers and practitioners for a short interview (online, ~30–45 minutes).  
The goal is to understand how AI-mediated interpretation can better support **cross-cultural comparison**, **provenance awareness**, and **plural narratives**.

**What the interview involves**
- How cross-cultural communication is handled in real situations, and what helps or hinders sensemaking
- Explore expectations and concerns about AI interpretation (authority, uncertainty, responsibility)
- Suggestions for improving the speculative design workshop (format, prompts, materials)
- Suggestions for shaping the technology probe (use scenarios, interactions, evaluation, ethics)

**To participate**
- Email: **jc15u24@soton.ac.uk**

## Project summary
<a id="project-summary"></a>

### Why this project
Online museum collections now contain millions of objects. While access is easier than ever, users often face:
- **Information overload** (search results ≠ understanding)
- **High barrier to entry** (specialist terms, implicit context)
- **Cross-cultural gaps** (meanings can be situated, contested, and plural)

### What this project asks
This project investigates:

> **How can AI-mediated systems support cross-cultural sensemaking in textile heritage as a “negotiation of meaning,” rather than delivering a single authoritative answer?**

Instead of producing “one correct interpretation,” the focus is to support:
- exploratory **comparison across artefacts**
- transparent **provenance and uncertainty cues**
- the ability to **retain plural narratives**, including disagreement

### What this project contributes (in plain terms)
- Interaction designs for **multi-voice, provenance-first interpretation**
- Evidence from speculative design + probes about what people trust, reject, and negotiate
- A configurable prototype that helps users **compare, question, and keep alternatives**

## Methods
<a id="methods"></a>

This project uses two design research methods that iteratively translate insights into interface mechanisms:

### 1) Speculative design 
Speculative Design explores future possibilities and societal impacts of emerging technology and shifting cultural and social trends, diverging from traditional design to provoke new thought, debate, directions, preferences, and strategy.

Speculative Design are used to explore futures of AI interpretation where meaning is **negotiated** rather than delivered.  
Participants work with prompts, artefact cards, and scenario-based activities.

### 2) Technology probes 
Technology probes can collect data about participants’ interactions. The primary purpose of technology probes is to gain understanding of users and how well the proposed solution addresses their needs. Technology probes implement selected interaction ideas as lightweight prototypes and place them in realistic browsing/interpretation tasks.

## Pilot workshop (completed)
<a id="pilot-workshop"></a>

A pilot speculative design workshop has been completed, and a **baseline workshop process framework** has been established.

**Ethics approval**  
This pilot workshop has received ethics approval: **ERGO Ⅱ：108753**.

</div>
These early insights are informing the next iteration of speculative workshop materials and probe designs.

## Image credits & ethics
- Any museum images used will respect institutional image policies and licensing.
- AI outputs will be clearly labeled, with provenance and uncertainty cues to avoid misleading authority.
